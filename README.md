# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

# Short Description
For this project a generic website was built containing the following:
- a navbar
- a menu navigation (unordered list) for 5 distinct pages including the home page (index)
- one table in the home page
- one image for each page

You can browse different pages and see different images on each page.

# HTML Files
Each page contains a navbar, a menu and an image. Additionally the home page contains a table.
- index.html
- page1.html
- page2.html
- page3.html
- page4.html

# Stylesheets
Most of the styling is in style.css with additional help from the sass.scss file.
- style.css
- sass.scss // sass.css

# Requirements 
- [OK] Your website must contain at least four different .html pages, and it should be possible to get from any page on your website to any other page by following one or more hyperlinks.
// Pages: Index, Page1, Page2, Page3, Page4

- [OK] Your website must include at least one list (ordered or unordered), at least one table, and at least one image.

- [OK] Your website must have at least one stylesheet file.
// Two stylesheets are present: style.css and sass.css

- [OK] Your stylesheet(s) must use at least five different CSS properties, and at least five different types of CSS selectors. You must use the #id selector at least once, and the .class selector at least once.

- [OK] Your stylesheet(s) must include at least one mobile-responsive @media query, such that something about the styling changes for smaller screens.
// The background changes to red for screens with widths smaller to 800px.

- [OK] You must use Bootstrap 4 on your website, taking advantage of at least one Bootstrap component, and using at least two Bootstrap columns for layout purposes using Bootstrap’s grid model.
// Navbar, table and list use Bootstrap components. Further, the various divs are arranged using Bootstrap's grid model.

- [OK] Your stylesheets must use at least one SCSS variable, at least one example of SCSS nesting, and at least one use of SCSS inheritance.
// Text color for menu links is set by a VARIABLE.
// Table headers and table data points are defined through their NESTING within the <table>
// Title text (H5) and menu header (H3) are extended using SCSS INHERITANCE.

- [OK] In README.md, include a short writeup describing your project, what’s contained in each file, and (optionally) any other additional information the staff should know about your project.
